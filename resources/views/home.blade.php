                <p>I was taking things to the next level. Girl Gang was a physical shop and we were looking to bring it online to gain traction on a national level. At the time we had a website but it was not set up for conversions and looked horrible, and we had no online presence other than social media and no brand awareness throughout Canada. So we needed Lumoâ€™s help to create digital growth (email, sales, exposure, awareness).</p>
                <p>We are SO happy with the website and the amount of care that went into it. It wasn't easy, especially since there are so many elements and Shopify isn't as user friendly for design. But Lumo had a high attention to detail and we had used them in the past so we knew we could rely on them. They get everything right the first time around and they listen to what your brand truly needs. You guys have been truly amazing. </p>
                <p>Thank you so much for your hard work and dedication to both SWC and Girl Gang. I can't even explain how valuable it has been to have a functional e-commerce website launch right before COVID hit. Without it, we potentially would have had to shut down the company. Right now we are at around 5k web hits/ month (achieved in 60 days with minimal marketing spend) and have had over 200 sales, closely approaching 15k in sales since April. Not only has having a functional website helped us stay afloat, but it's helping our members stay afloat. I can't even begin to explain how happy we with what has been provided. Thank you guys!!</p>
